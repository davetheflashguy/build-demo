build-demo
==========

## Synopsis

A starting point for your Angular applications or prototypes that already includes and configures many tasteful treats that you typically need when building an applications, regardless of the size.  The idea is for any application you build you will need things like a framework to build your application,  a build tool to stitch up your applications, a UI framework, a node server to run your applications, unit testing server to test your applications, and the basic bower components necessary to build an angular application ready to go.

## Motivation

Each and every time I build something, regardless if its an example of a simple Angular directive example or if its a complex UI, I want a basic yet powerful environment to build in.  It should have everything I need, pre configured for me to focus on the task at hand instead of spending time getting up and running.  I was tired of spending time doing the same bower and npm installs every time I fire up a new project so I decided to put this project together.
